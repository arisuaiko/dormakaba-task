## Test Automation Framework with Playwright

This repository contains a small Page Object Model (POM) based automation framework built with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). 
It demonstrates end-to-end test automation for a predefined scenario on [Automation Exercise](https://www.automationexercise.com/).

### Automated Scenario

The following user journey is automated as part of this task:

1. Navigate to the home page: https://www.automationexercise.com/
2. Go to the **Products** section
3. Select the **Men > Jeans** category
4. Add a couple of **Jeans** items to the cart
5. Verify the contents of the cart.

### Tech Stack

- **Playwright** â€“ Browser automation
- **TypeScript** â€“ Strongly-typed language support
- **Node.js** â€“ Runtime environment
- **POM (Page Object Model)** â€“ Code structure for maintainability 
- **Allure Reports** â€“ For advanced test reporting
